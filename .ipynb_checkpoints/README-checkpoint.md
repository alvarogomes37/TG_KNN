KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. KNN falls in the supervised learning family of algorithms. Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consiting of training observations  (x,y)  and would like to capture the relationship between  x  and  y . More formally, our goal is to learn a function  h:Xâ†’Y  so that given an unseen observation  x ,  h(x)  can confidently predict the corresponding output  y
